# Crop-Advisory-System
Marginal farmers often face critical challenges in making informed agricultural decisions due 
to limited access to timely information, expert guidance, and region-specific resources. To 
address these constraints, this project proposes an AI-Integrated Crop Advisory System that 
delivers personalized, data-driven recommendations by combining multilingual 
communication, soil analytics, real-time weather forecasting, and dynamic market price 
intelligence. 
The system leverages machine learning models to analyze soil parameters such as moisture, 
pH, and nutrient levels, and integrates weather APIs to predict rainfall, temperature variations, 
and potential climate risks. Additionally, market analytics provide updated crop price trends 
from nearby mandis, enabling farmers to choose crops that maximize profitability. The system 
uses multilingual natural language processing (NLP) to communicate advisory outputs in 
the farmer’s preferred language, ensuring accessibility for diverse rural communities. 
The proposed system guides farmers in crop selection, fertilizer management, irrigation 
scheduling, and pest/disease alerts while promoting sustainable agricultural practices. By 
delivering accurate and context-aware insights through a simple and intuitive interface, the AI
enabled platform empowers marginal farmers to increase yield, reduce crop risk, and improve 
income stability. This integrated approach demonstrates how emerging technologies can bridge 
the information gap and support inclusive, smart agriculture at the grassroots level.
